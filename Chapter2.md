Chapter 2:

After a long day of work, a young archaeologist stumbles across a glacier in the distance that possess a suspicious spec that seemed to resemble a humanoid lizard but that could not be possible.

Then suddenly, the glacier bursts and a cascade of shards appear as the lizard slowly opens its eyes and moves slowly towards the archaelogist.
