When the hyper intellectual lizards emerged from the Glacier, they were shocked to see that there were humans everywhere!
Before they were in the glacier, they were the only species to live on Earth.
The first thing that the archaeologist showed them were all of the great inventions that the humans made, like air conditioned shoes.
The lizards were not impressed and just wanted their home back, but they were severely outnumbered.
Waging a war was not a good idea since there were more humans than lizards and the humans had technology!
But these weren't just any lizards, these were hyper intelligent lizards-- they would find a way.
