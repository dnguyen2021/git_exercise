Long ago, way before Homo sapiens roamed the Earth,
hyperintellectual lizards ruled the world. They
dominated a highly technological advanced
society that was lost in the Deep Winter.
Two lizards in particular, Lizzy and Lizzurd,
were natural leaders that led the society into
the Bright Age, where everyone flourished and
went to sleep with full bellie. It wasn't until
the end of the Bright Age, did they realize
the impending doom of what came to be known
as the Deep Winter. By the time they realized the
Deep Winter was approaching, it was too late. A nearly
mass extinction of the lizards wiped out everyone,
except for Lizzy and Lizzurd. Those two were flash
frozen inside of a glacier, for a thousand
years, before anyone discovered them.
